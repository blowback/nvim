# Ant's neovim config

Now 100% Lua and nicely modularised.

Here's a list of the plugins I've added and their keybindings / commands, which I will never remember:

## Lazy.nvim

Lazy package and dependency manager. Use `:Lazy` to see what it's up to.

## Telescope and friends
Open Telescope with `:Telescope` which will cause it to lazy-load along with it's dependencies.

One of these `native-fzf` is native and requires building: if that doesn't happen automatically, use Lazy's UI to build it with `gb`.
